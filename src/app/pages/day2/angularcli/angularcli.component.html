  <h2>Angular CLI</h2>
  <p>
    Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that helps
    developers initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications
    efficiently. It provides a set of commands that automate many of the tasks
    involved in Angular development, such as creating components, services,
    modules, and setting up testing environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Angular CLI, you can quickly generate boilerplate code using simple
    commands like <code>ng generate component</code> or
    <code>ng generate service</code>. It also handles the build process with
    commands such as <code>ng build</code>, runs a development server using
    <code>ng serve</code>, and helps you run unit tests with
    <code>ng test</code> or end-to-end tests using <code>ng e2e</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Angular CLI ensures that best practices are followed by default, and it
    integrates with Webpack under the hood to optimize bundling, tree-shaking,
    and performance. It's especially useful for beginners because it hides
    complex configurations and allows developers to focus on building features.
  </p>
  <p>
    To install Angular CLI globally, use the following command in your terminal:
    <br />
    <code>npm install -g &#64;angular/cli</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once installed, you can create a new Angular project using:
    <br />
    <code>ng new project-name</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, Angular CLI is an essential tool for Angular developers that boosts
    productivity, maintains consistency, and simplifies project setup and
    maintenance.
